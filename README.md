This is my final project for the Machine Learning course at DIS-Stockholm. 

To run this code, the dataset must be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shoumikgoswami/annotated-gmb-corpus/data)

Instructions:
* Download the dataset and save to file path
* Run cells to upload and missing dependancies
* Run cells line by line to see the graphs and train the models

DISCLAIMER:
If running on Google co-lab, additional GPU may be needed.
